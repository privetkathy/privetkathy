# 💫 About Me:
✅ I’m a detail-oriented QA Engineer with 1+ years of hands-on experience in manual testing of business-critical systems, primarily in the telecom domain. I specialize in validating complex business logic, billing accuracy, and web-based internal systems, ensuring stable and predictable product behavior.<br><br>🚀 I enjoy working with product-oriented teams where quality, reliability, and clear processes matter. My background is in telecom and billing platforms, but I’m open to contributing to product companies, SaaS, fintech, edtech, and other domains where correctness and system stability are essential.<br><br>Key contributions and impact:<br>🔹Identified a critical configuration issue in a billing mediation system, reducing CDR processing time from several hours to 15 minutes and aligning the system with business requirements.<br>🔹Prevented potential incorrect charges and revenue-impacting issues by detecting tariff plan misconfigurations before production releases.<br>🔹Supported stable launches of new tariff plans, promotions, and service changes through full-cycle testing (analysis, test cases, execution, production validation).<br>🔹Improved QA efficiency by introducing reusable test case templates and clearer task structuring, reducing repetitive manual work and improving transparency for stakeholders.<br>🔹Ensured consistency between UI, backend logic, and database data across multiple internal systems.<br><br>💡 I value structured work, open communication, and continuous improvement. I’m currently expanding my skills in UI and web test automation using Java and Selenium, focusing on automating real business scenarios rather than isolated test cases.<br><br>If your team is building reliable, user-focused digital products and values a QA Engineer who thinks about quality from both a technical and business perspective — let’s connect.<br><br>📩 httpskateriox@gmail.com
